  ## Description
  
  Community Helper is an application built with React, DAML, & TypeScript. This application matches neighbors with skills with neighbors in need. Utilizes smart contracts for work proposals/contracts.

  Deposit Funds to your wallet, Edit your skillset, View Other community Members or submit a work proposal via a form.  Once a work proposal is submitted, the worker can either accept or reject the proposal.  If accepted, the proposal becomes a contract.  If rejected, the proposal can either be edited to more acceptable terms or canceled.
